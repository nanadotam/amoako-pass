Excellent idea ‚Äî adding **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)** using time-based codes like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator is üîê security gold for a password manager. What you're talking about is implementing **TOTP** ‚Äî Time-Based One-Time Passwords.

Let me walk you through it like a mentor. No rush.

---

## üîê What is TOTP?

TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) is a method where a secret key + current time ‚Üí generates a 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds.

These codes can be verified server-side using the same secret + time logic.

### üì± Apps like:

* Google Authenticator
* Microsoft Authenticator
* Authy
  ...all scan a **QR code** or **manual secret** and then start generating codes.

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Implement TOTP in Go

### 1. A library that handles TOTP

Use [`github.com/pquerna/otp`](https://github.com/pquerna/otp) ‚Äî it supports both TOTP and HOTP.

Install it:

```bash
go get github.com/pquerna/otp
go get github.com/pquerna/otp/totp
```

---

### 2. Backend Workflow

Here's a full breakdown:

### ‚û§ Step 1: Generate a TOTP secret for the user

```go
package services

import (
	"github.com/pquerna/otp"
	"github.com/pquerna/otp/totp"
)

func GenerateTOTPSecret(email string) (string, string, error) {
	key, err := totp.Generate(totp.GenerateOpts{
		Issuer:      "AmoakoPass",
		AccountName: email,
	})
	if err != nil {
		return "", "", err
	}
	// key.Secret() ‚Üí base32 encoded string (store in DB)
	// key.URL() ‚Üí used to create QR codes for authenticator apps
	return key.Secret(), key.URL(), nil
}
```

---

### ‚û§ Step 2: Send the user the QR code or secret

You can:

* Show them the **QR code** (using key.URL())
* Or show the **secret string** (like `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`)

They scan this with their authenticator app.

---

### ‚û§ Step 3: Store the secret securely

* Add a `two_factor_secret` field to your users table
* You can encrypt it before saving
* Make sure it‚Äôs only visible to your backend

---

### ‚û§ Step 4: Validate the code during login or sensitive actions

```go
package services

import (
	"github.com/pquerna/otp/totp"
	"time"
)

func VerifyTOTPCode(secret, code string) bool {
	return totp.Validate(code, secret)
}
```

---

### ‚û§ Step 5: Let users enable/disable 2FA

Update your user model like:

```go
type User struct {
	// ...
	TwoFactorEnabled bool
	TwoFactorSecret  *string
}
```

Let them toggle this in settings.

---

## üß™ Sample Flow: Enabling 2FA

1. User goes to ‚ÄúEnable 2FA‚Äù
2. Backend calls `GenerateTOTPSecret(email)`
3. Show user the **QR code** or secret
4. User scans it with Authenticator app
5. User enters the 6-digit code to confirm setup
6. You verify it using `VerifyTOTPCode()`
7. If valid, save the secret in the DB and mark 2FA enabled ‚úÖ

---

## üß† Bonus: Showing the QR Code

Use an image library like `github.com/skip2/go-qrcode`

```go
import "github.com/skip2/go-qrcode"

func GenerateQRCode(url string) ([]byte, error) {
	return qrcode.Encode(url, qrcode.Medium, 256) // returns PNG byte array
}
```

Then serve it in an endpoint and display it in your frontend.

---

## ‚ú® Optional but Secure:

* Hash the secret before storing (but you'll need to decrypt for validation)
* Only allow TOTP setup if the user enters their password again
* Rotate the secret after reset

---

Would you like me to:

* Generate the full handler flow?
* Show how to store it in Supabase?
* Or give you a test HTML page to preview the QR code?

Let‚Äôs build it piece by piece.
